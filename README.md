**My favorite movies and series**

> These are the movies that I always like watching when I do not have anything to do.

--------

  - Hello world - is an animated movie set in kyoto where the government collected and preserved the city's natural culture and architectures through drones in real time. The data collected is saved into a quantum computer known as Alltale. 
  - Koe no Katachi - is a movie about an elementary boy who bullied his deaf classmate with his friends. A few years later, they reunited in a school for special people where they talked about the past.
  - Your lie in april - This is one of the best movies that I have watched. This is a story about a young pianist known for playing the piano with perfection. Then he met Kaori, a girl who was able to watch Kousei's piano piece when they were still children and she loved how Kousei plays piano.
